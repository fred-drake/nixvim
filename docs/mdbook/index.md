## What is it?
NixVim is a [Neovim](https://neovim.io) distribution built around
[Nix](https://nixos.org) modules. It is distributed as a Nix flake, and
configured through Nix, all while leaving room for your plugins and your vimrc.

## What does it look like?
Here is a simple configuration that uses catppuccin as the colorscheme and uses the
lualine plugin:

```nix
{
  programs.nixvim = {
    enable = true;

    colorschemes.catppuccin.enable = true;
    plugins.lualine.enable = true;
  };
}
```

When we do this, lualine will be set up to a sensible default, and will use
catppuccin as the colorscheme, no extra configuration required!

## Welcome to the docs!

Over to the left, you'll find the sidebar. There you'll see several "User guides" (including an [FAQ](./user-guide/faq.md)]), along with pages for various "options".

While you can search our main docs using the <i class="fa fa-search"></i> icon, if you're looking for a specific option you may find the dedicated [Nixvim Option Search](./search/index.html) (at the bottom of the sidebar) has more relevant results.

> [!TIP]
> Any page with a ‚ù± icon next to it has one-or-more _sub-pages_.
