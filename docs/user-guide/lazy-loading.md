# Lazy Loading

> [!WARNING]
> This is an experimental option and may not work as expected with all plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> When the lazy loading functionality is enabled, the plugin's configuration is
> routed to the enabled lazy provider. Options mentioned will be in relation to

## Supported Lazy Loading Providers

It is recommended to become familiar with lazy loading strategies supported by
your provider in their upstream documentation and the corresponding plugin's
support.

Currently we only support **one** lazy loader:

- lz.n: [`plugins.lz-n`](../plugins/lz-n/index.md) -
  [upstream docs](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lz.n?tab=readme-ov-file#plugin-spec)

## Enabling Lazy Loading Per Plugin

You can enable lazy loading for a plugin by passing a configuration to
`lazyLoad.settings`. This configuration is passed through to the lazy loading
provider's loading mechanism.

If you are just wanting to store potential configuration without enabling it,
you can explicitly disable it setting `lazyLoad.enable = false`.

By default, we route the generated setup code to your lazy loading provider, but
it can be overridden by using the `lazyLoad.settings` option.

For `Lz.n`, the `lazyLoad.settings.after` option contains what it will call when
a trigger condition is met.

## Configuring Triggers

You need to define the trigger conditions in which a plugin will be loaded. This
is done through the `lazyLoad.settings` option.

```nix
plugins = {
  grug-far = {
    enable = true;
    lazyLoad = {
      settings = {
        cmd = "GrugFar";
      };
    };
  };
};
```

```nix
plugins = {
  glow = {
    enable = true;
    lazyLoad.settings.ft = "markdown";
  };
```

```nix
plugins.toggleterm = {
  enable = true;
  lazyLoad = {
    settings = {
      cmd = "ToggleTerm";
      keys = [
        "<leader>tg"
        "<leader>gg"
      ];
    };
  };
};
```

### Colorschemes

Colorschemes do not require explicit settings configuration. In `lz-n`, we will
set up the `colorscheme` trigger to the name of the `colorscheme` so that it is
lazy loaded when the `colorscheme` is requested.

```nix
colorscheme = "catppuccin";
colorschemes.catppuccin = {
  enable = true;
  lazyLoad.enable = true;
};
```
