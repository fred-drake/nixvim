# User configurations

Want some help with starting your configuration?
Or maybe you're curious how others have done things?
Take a look at these configuration examples below.

<!-- TODO: add info about `kickstart.nixvim` -->

**Note:**\
Most of those configurations are using a [standalone build](../platforms/standalone.html), however,
all of the nixvim options are accessible no matter how you are using it (flake, NixOS/HM module, nix-darwin...).

@USER_CONFIGS@

## Share your config !

> [!TIP]
> You can add your config to the list by editing the [`docs/user-configs/list.toml`] file.

Please use this format for both your commit message and PR title: \
`user-configs: add @Username's config"` \
(replacing `Username` with your github username)

Alternatively, message us in the [matrix _Documentation_ room] and we'll get it added.
